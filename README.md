This repository contains the sample code to indicate `how do I detect compile type from class files`.

We can get the *source* file name from Java byte code.
i.e. We can get `"Hello.kt"` from `Hello.class` file.

This repository contains 2 sample codes. BCEL version and ASM version. Both Java byte code parser/generator libraries can
get the source file name from byte code.
